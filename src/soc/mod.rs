//! Per-chip SoC description + the chip-neutral PAC alias.
//!
//! This HAL supports a family of HiSilicon "HimiDeer" RISC-V SoCs. Exactly one
//! chip is selected at compile time via a cargo feature:
//! - `chip-ws63` (default) — WS63 (Wi-Fi6 + BLE + SLE), `ws63-pac`
//! - `chip-bs21` — BS21/BS2X (BLE + SLE/NearLink), `bs21-pac`
//!
//! Drivers never name a vendor PAC or a chip module directly; they go through the
//! chip-neutral aliases [`pac`] (the active Peripheral Access Crate) and [`chip`]
//! (the active `soc/<chip>.rs` description: memory map, clock constants, instance
//! counts, the `Interrupt` enum). Adding a chip = a new `soc/<chip>.rs` + a PAC.
