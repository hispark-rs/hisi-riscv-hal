//! WS63 D-cache maintenance via the HiSilicon custom RISC-V CSRs.
//!
//! The WS63 core has a **4 KB, 32-byte-line, non-coherent** data cache (enabled
//! at boot). A DMA / bus master sees physical RAM directly, so software must keep
//! the cache and RAM in sync around a transfer:
//!
//! * **Before** a master *reads* CPU-written data — [`clean_range`] (write the
//!   dirty cache lines back to RAM) so the master sees the new bytes.
//! * **After** a master *writes* memory, before the CPU reads it —
//!   [`invalidate_range`] (drop the stale cache lines) so the CPU re-fetches from
//!   RAM instead of returning the old cached value.
//!
//! Cache control uses two custom CSRs (mirroring the vendor LiteOS
//! `arch/riscv/include/arch/cache.h` + `osal_dcache_*`):
//! `DCINCVA` (`0x7C5`, the target address) and `DCMAINT` (`0x7C3`, the command,
//! whose bits are `VA = 0x1` "by virtual address", `DCIV = 0x4` "invalidate",
//! `DCC = 0x8` "clean"). The vendor `hal_dma_v151_enable()` flushes the whole
//! D-cache before kicking a transfer; these by-range ops are the finer-grained
//! equivalent.
//!
//! All ops are no-ops on a non-riscv (host) build so the crate's host unit tests
//! still compile.
