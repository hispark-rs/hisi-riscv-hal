//! # hisi-riscv-hal — Hardware Abstraction Layer for HiSilicon WS63 (RISC-V).
//!
//! A comprehensive HAL providing safe, idiomatic Rust APIs for all WS63
//! peripherals. Modeled on esp-hal patterns with type-state GPIO, RAII
//! clock guards, DMA typing, and embedded-hal trait implementations.
//!
//! ## Clock gating
//!
//! Most peripherals need their CLDO_CRG clock gate enabled before register
//! access. The gates default to enabled out of reset; `clock_init::init_clocks()`
//! sets up the system clocks for firmware that does not boot through flashboot.
//! Constructors like `I2c::new_i2c0()`, `Uart::new_uart0()`, and `Watchdog::new()`
//! write configuration registers immediately. WDT/RTC/TCXO are always-on.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! let clocks = clock_init::init_clocks(&system.sys_ctl0, &system.cldo_crg);
//! // Now safe to construct peripheral drivers
//! let uart = Uart::new_uart0(peripherals.UART0, Config::default());
//! ```
// `no_std` for firmware builds; `std` is linked under `cfg(test)` ONLY on the
// host so the lib unit tests can use the standard test harness (run via
// `cargo test --target x86_64`). On the RISC-V target the lib stays `no_std`
// even under the `test` cfg: `cargo test --target riscv32imfc-...` builds the
// lib-test target too (alongside tests/hil.rs), and `std`/`test` don't exist on
// the bare-metal target — the host-only unit-test modules are themselves gated
// `#[cfg(all(test, not(target_arch = "riscv32")))]`, so they vanish there.
#![cfg_attr(not(all(test, not(target_arch = "riscv32"))), no_std)]

#![allow(rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links)]

// Exactly one chip must be selected (each pulls its PAC + soc/<chip>.rs). There is
// NO default chip (esp-hal style) — every consumer names one explicitly.
