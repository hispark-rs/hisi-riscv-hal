# Migration From `hisi-riscv-hal`

`hisi-riscv-hal 0.6.x` is the final release line under the original package
name. It remains available on crates.io and the `release/0.6` branch accepts
critical correctness and security fixes.

New development continues as `hisi-hal`, beginning with `0.7.0-alpha.1`. The
rename does not imply a new hardware abstraction, feature policy, or stable API
surface. It gives the multi-chip HAL a name that is not tied to one ISA spelling.

The normal migration is:

```toml
[dependencies]
hisi-hal = { version = "0.7.0-alpha.1", features = ["chip-ws63"] }
```

and Rust imports change from `hisi_riscv_hal` to `hisi_hal`.

For a staged manifest-only migration, retain the old dependency key and source
imports while resolving the new package:

```toml
[dependencies]
hisi-riscv-hal = { package = "hisi-hal", version = "0.7.0-alpha.1", features = ["chip-ws63"] }
```

Do not depend on the GitHub repository redirect as a build contract. Released
applications should use the crates.io package and an explicit version range.
