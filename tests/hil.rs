//! On-target (semihosting) HIL **driver** tests for the HAL, run on real WS63
//! silicon (and safe under QEMU). These live here — inside the HAL crate's
//! `tests/` — so the HAL's own driver tests ship and run with the HAL and inherit
//! its chip gating (`chip-ws63` default, `chip-bs21` via `--features chip-bs21`).
//! The cross-cutting CPU/PAC smoke tests live separately in the `tests-hil`
//! crate.
//!
//! Built with
//! `cargo test -p hisi-riscv-hal --no-default-features --features chip-ws63 \
//!      --target riscv32imfc-unknown-none-elf --test hil`
//! and run on real silicon by the patched probe-rs fork via the
//! `hil/embedded-test-runner.sh` cargo runner (see ../../../hil/README.md). Each
//! test is executed in turn over the semihosting channel; the result is reported
//! back to `probe-rs run` (libtest-compatible).
//!
//! ## Why `--test hil` (not a bare `cargo test --target riscv…`)
//!
//! The HAL keeps its host unit tests in `src/*.rs` (`#[cfg(all(test,
//! not(target_arch = "riscv32")))]`), so the crate's *lib* test target uses the
//! default libtest harness — which links the `test`/`std` crates that do NOT
//! exist for the bare-metal `riscv32imfc-unknown-none-elf` target (only
//! core/alloc are shipped). A bare `cargo test --target riscv…` would try to
//! build that lib-test target and fail to link `test`. Scoping to `--test hil`
//! builds ONLY this embedded-test integration target (its own `harness = false`
//! provides `main`), so the on-target build/run never touches the host-only
//! lib-test harness. The host unit tests are unaffected and still run via
//! `cargo test -p hisi-riscv-hal --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`.
//!
//! ## Entry-point interaction with hisi-riscv-rt
//!
//! We do NOT use `hisi_riscv_rt::entry` here. embedded-test exports the C symbol
//! `main` (its test dispatcher), and hisi-riscv-rt's `runtime_init` (the tail of
//! the assembly startup) calls `extern "Rust" fn main()` after BSS-zero/data-copy
//! — so embedded-test's `main` IS the entry. hisi-riscv-rt still supplies the
//! reset vector, the `critical-section-single-hart` impl (backing
//! portable-atomic's RMW polyfill on this no-atomic core), and — via the
//! `boot-header` feature (turned on by the HAL's chip-ws63 feature) — the 0x300
//! image header that makes the ELF bootable. embedded-test also provides the
//! `#[panic_handler]` (it aborts via semihosting), so we must not define one.
//!
//! As an external integration test this still depends on the chip PAC via a
//! cfg-selected alias (`ws63_pac as pac` / `bs2x_pac as pac`) — the HAL keeps its
//! own PAC `pub(crate)`, so the test names the PAC directly for the raw register
//! and singleton facts.
//!
//! The default suite is self-contained: no jumpers / external wiring, safe on a
//! bare board and under QEMU. The opt-in `hil-loopback` cargo feature adds tests
//! that DO require external jumpers — GPIO3↔GPIO5, SPI0 GPIO9↔GPIO11, and UART1
//! GPIO15↔GPIO16 — for validating real on-silicon data paths; run them with
//! `--features chip-ws63,hil-loopback` on a board wired accordingly.

// This is an on-target (RISC-V, semihosting) integration test: it links
// hisi-riscv-rt + the embedded-test harness, both of which are riscv-only
// dev-deps (see Cargo.toml's `[target.'cfg(target_arch = "riscv32")']` block).
// `cargo test` builds every integration-test target for whatever target is being
// tested, so on the host (`cargo test --target x86_64`, the HAL's lib unit-test
// run) this file would otherwise fail to find those crates. Gate the whole file
// to riscv so on the host it compiles to a trivial harness-less binary (an empty
// `main`, required because this `[[test]]` sets `harness = false`) and the host
// unit-test build is unaffected.

    //      now does — the per-channel CFG `ch_enable` bit alone does not start the

    //      this test detect "done" — NOT `dmac_ori_int_st` (the QEMU path).
    //   2. CLOCK: `enable_controller()` bypasses the M_DMA auto-clock-gate
    //      (DMA_CLK_AUTO_CTRL_REG 0x4400_0244 |= 0x80000) so the clock stays on.

    //      `cache::clean_range(src)` before (flush the CPU's bytes to RAM) and
    //      `cache::invalidate_range(dst)` after (drop the stale cached zeros).
